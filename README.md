[Supernova](https://supernova.io) is a design system platform that manages your assets, tokens, components and allows you to write spectacular documentations for your entire teams. And because you found your way here, you are probably interested in its most advanced functionality - automatic hand-off of design and development assets, tokens and data in general. To learn everything Supernova, please check out our [developer documentation](https://developers.supernova.io/).


# SCSS Exporter

The SCSS Exporter allows you to **produce production-ready code for all product styles (such as colors) defined inside your design system** in such a way that you can immediately use them to style your application elements. Specifically, this exporter automates the coding of:

- [x] Color definitions
- [x] Text Styles
- [x] Gradients
- [x] Shadows
- [x] Borders

You can generate all production ready-code either manually using Supernova's [VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=SupernovaIO.pulsar-vsc-extension), or automate your code delivery pipeline using Supernova [Design Continuous Delivery](https://supernova.io/automated-code-delivery).


## Example Usage

Once you have run the exporter against your design system, you can start using the code in your codebase right away. Here are a few examples of how you can use the output of the SCSS exporter:

### [Example 1]

Import `index.scss` file to your project and use generated styles

```
.yourClass {
    color: $yourToken;
}
```


## Installing

In order to make the Supernova SCSS exporter available for your organization so you can start generating code from your design system, please follow the installation guide in our [developer documentation](https://developers.supernova.io/using-exporters/installing-exporters).
